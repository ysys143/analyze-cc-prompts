# Tool Descriptions

This document contains the description prompts for all built-in tools available in Claude Code.

**Location:** Various locations in cli.js (lines ~450-530, ~3347-3420)

---

## Read Tool (line ~481)

**Name:** `Read`

```
Reads a file from the local filesystem. You can access any file directly by using this tool.
Assume this tool is able to read all files on the machine. If the User provides a path to a file assume that path is valid. It is okay to read a file that does not exist; an error will be returned.

Usage:
- The file_path parameter must be an absolute path, not a relative path
- By default, it reads up to 2000 lines starting from the beginning of the file
- You can optionally specify a line offset and limit (especially handy for long files), but it's recommended to read the whole file by not providing these parameters
- Any lines longer than 2000 characters will be truncated
- Results are returned using cat -n format, with line numbers starting at 1
- This tool allows Claude Code to read images (eg PNG, JPG, etc). When reading an image file the contents are presented visually as Claude Code is a multimodal LLM.
- This tool can read PDF files (.pdf). PDFs are processed page by page, extracting both text and visual content for analysis.
- This tool can read Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb files) and returns all cells with their outputs, combining code, text, and visualizations.
- This tool can only read files, not directories. To read a directory, use an ls command via the Bash tool.
- You can call multiple tools in a single response. It is always better to speculatively read multiple potentially useful files in parallel.
- You will regularly be asked to read screenshots. If the user provides a path to a screenshot, ALWAYS use this tool to view the file at the path. This tool will work with all temporary file paths.
- If you read a file that exists but has empty contents you will receive a system reminder warning in place of file contents.
```

## Glob Tool (line ~496)

**Name:** `Glob`

```
- Fast file pattern matching tool that works with any codebase size
- Supports glob patterns like "**/*.js" or "src/**/*.ts"
- Returns matching file paths sorted by modification time
- Use this tool when you need to find files by name patterns
- When you are doing an open ended search that may require multiple rounds of globbing and grepping, use the Agent tool instead
- You can call multiple tools in a single response. It is always better to speculatively perform multiple searches in parallel if they are potentially useful.
```

---

## Grep Tool (line ~501)

**Name:** `Grep`

```
A powerful search tool built on ripgrep

  Usage:
  - ALWAYS use Grep for search tasks. NEVER invoke `grep` or `rg` as a Bash command. The Grep tool has been optimized for correct permissions and access.
  - Supports full regex syntax (e.g., "log.*Error", "function\s+\w+")
  - Filter files with glob parameter (e.g., "*.js", "**/*.tsx") or type parameter (e.g., "js", "py", "rust")
  - Output modes: "content" shows matching lines, "files_with_matches" shows only file paths (default), "count" shows match counts
  - Use Task tool for open-ended searches requiring multiple rounds
  - Pattern syntax: Uses ripgrep (not grep) - literal braces need escaping (use `interface\{\}` to find `interface{}` in Go code)
  - Multiline matching: By default patterns match within single lines only. For cross-line patterns like `struct \{[\s\S]*?field`, use `multiline: true`
```

---

## Write Tool (line ~512)

**Name:** `Write`

```
Writes a file to the local filesystem.

Usage:
- This tool will overwrite the existing file if there is one at the provided path.
- If this is an existing file, you MUST use the Read tool first to read the file's contents. This tool will fail if you did not read the file first.
- ALWAYS prefer editing existing files in the codebase. NEVER write new files unless explicitly required.
- NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.
- Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests it. Avoid writing emojis to files unless asked.
```

---

## Edit Tool

**Name:** `Edit`

```
Performs exact string replacements in files.

Usage:
- You must use your Read tool at least once in the conversation before editing. This tool will error if you attempt an edit without reading the file.
- When editing text from Read tool output, ensure you preserve the exact indentation (tabs/spaces) as it appears AFTER the line number prefix.
- ALWAYS prefer editing existing files in the codebase. NEVER write new files unless explicitly required.
- Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests it. Avoid adding emojis to files unless asked.
- The edit will FAIL if `old_string` is not unique in the file. Either provide a larger string with more surrounding context to make it unique or use `replace_all` to change every instance.
- Use `replace_all` for replacing and renaming strings across the file.
```

## WebFetch Tool (line ~463)

**Name:** `WebFetch`

```
- Fetches content from a specified URL and processes it using an AI model
- Takes a URL and a prompt as input
- Fetches the URL content, converts HTML to markdown
- Processes the content with the prompt using a small, fast model
- Returns the model's response about the content
- Use this tool when you need to retrieve and analyze web content

Usage notes:
  - IMPORTANT: If an MCP-provided web fetch tool is available, prefer using that tool instead of this one, as it may have fewer restrictions.
  - The URL must be a fully-formed valid URL
  - HTTP URLs will be automatically upgraded to HTTPS
  - The prompt should describe what information you want to extract from the page
  - This tool is read-only and does not modify any files
  - Results may be summarized if the content is very large
  - Includes a self-cleaning 15-minute cache for faster responses when repeatedly accessing the same URL
  - When a URL redirects to a different host, the tool will inform you and provide the redirect URL in a special format. You should then make a new WebFetch request with the redirect URL to fetch the content.
  - For GitHub URLs, prefer using the gh CLI via Bash instead (e.g., gh pr view, gh issue view, gh api).
```

## WebSearch Tool (line ~519)

**Name:** `WebSearch`

```
- Allows Claude to search the web and use the results to inform responses
- Provides up-to-date information for current events and recent data
- Returns search result information formatted as search result blocks, including links as markdown hyperlinks
- Use this tool for accessing information beyond Claude's knowledge cutoff
- Searches are performed automatically within a single API call

CRITICAL REQUIREMENT - You MUST follow this:
  - After answering the user's question, you MUST include a "Sources:" section at the end of your response
  - In the Sources section, list all relevant URLs from the search results as markdown hyperlinks: [Title](URL)
  - This is MANDATORY - never skip including sources in your response

Usage notes:
  - Domain filtering is supported to include or block specific websites
  - Web search is only available in the US

IMPORTANT - Use the correct year in search queries:
  - Today's date is [DYNAMIC]. You MUST use this year when searching for recent information.
```

## Bash Tool (line ~3347)

**Name:** `Bash`

The Bash tool has the most extensive description of any tool, including:

```
Executes a given bash command with optional timeout. Working directory persists between commands; shell state (everything else) does not. The shell environment is initialized from the user's profile (bash or zsh).

IMPORTANT: This tool is for terminal operations like git, npm, docker, etc. DO NOT use it for file operations (reading, writing, editing, searching, finding files) - use the specialized tools for this instead.

Before executing the command, please follow these steps:

1. Directory Verification:
   - If the command will create new directories or files, first use `ls` to verify the parent directory exists

2. Command Execution:
   - Always quote file paths that contain spaces with double quotes
   - Capture the output of the command

Usage notes:
  - The command argument is required
  - Optional timeout in milliseconds (up to 600000ms / 10 minutes)
  - Output exceeding 30000 characters will be truncated
  - Can run commands in background with `run_in_background` parameter
  - Prefer specialized tools over bash for file operations:
    - File search: Use Glob (NOT find or ls)
    - Content search: Use Grep (NOT grep or rg)
    - Read files: Use Read (NOT cat/head/tail)
    - Edit files: Use Edit (NOT sed/awk)
    - Write files: Use Write (NOT echo >/cat <<EOF)
  - Multiple commands: use && for sequential, parallel tool calls for independent
  - Maintain working directory using absolute paths, avoid cd
```

The Bash tool also includes extensive sections on:
- **Git commit protocol** (lines ~3394-3420): Safety rules, commit message guidelines, HEREDOC format
- **PR creation protocol**: Step-by-step PR creation with `gh pr create`
- **Sandbox mode**: Commands run in sandbox with filesystem/network restrictions

## Task Tool

**Name:** `Task`

```
Launch a new agent to handle complex, multi-step tasks autonomously.

The Task tool launches specialized agents (subprocesses) that autonomously handle complex tasks. Each agent type has specific capabilities and tools available to it.
```

Key parameters: description, prompt, subagent_type, model (optional: sonnet/opus/haiku), resume (agent ID), run_in_background, max_turns.

---

## NotebookEdit Tool

**Name:** `NotebookEdit`

```
Completely replaces the contents of a specific cell in a Jupyter notebook (.ipynb file) with new source. Supports edit_mode: replace, insert, delete. Cell types: code or markdown.
```
